# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications where a page component is missing a return statement. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in your application.

## Bug Description

In Next.js, page components are required to return JSX. If you omit the `return` statement, the component won't render correctly, resulting in an error.  This is particularly easy to miss when refactoring or adding new components.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about` in your browser. You'll see an error indicating that the component is missing a return statement.

## Solution

Ensure that all your page components include a `return` statement that returns valid JSX. The `aboutSolution.js` file shows the corrected version of `about.js`
